# Usage

We use Condinst code directly from AdelaiDet. Please follow their official instructions for installation: **[[`Installation`](https://github.com/aim-uofa/AdelaiDet#installation)]**.

The complete train script is provided as multiple changes were neccessary (i.e. configs cannot be loaded and trained directly) and added consistency for ease of usage. Run in similar fashion to the regular training script (refer to README.md at project root for more info).
